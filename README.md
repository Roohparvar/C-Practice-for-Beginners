# C Practice for Beginners

This repository has been created in response to student requests for programming exercises suitable for beginners. It contains a collection of exercises that I personally worked on during the early stages of learning programming. The exercises are designed to help students practice fundamental programming concepts in C.

## Exercises Overview

1. **Character and ASCII Code**: This program displays the uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet along with their corresponding ASCII codes.
2. **Character Counter**: This program prompts the user to enter a string and counts the number of letters in that string until the user enters a dot (.). For example, if the user enters the string "Hello.", the program will print the count as 5.
3. **Count Case Characters**: This program takes a sentence from the user that ends with a dot and counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in that sentence, printing the results.
4. **Decimal to Binary Converter**: This program takes a base-10 number from the user and converts it to its binary equivalent, displaying the result.
5. **Digit Sum Calculator**: This program takes a number from the user, calculates the sum of its digits, and prints the result. The user can enter multiple numbers, and to terminate the program, they enter -1.
6. **Euler's Number Calculator**: This program calculates Euler's number (Napier's number) using the formula of the sum of the inverse factorials. The user can specify the value of n to determine how precise the calculation is.
7. **Fibonacci Series Generator**: This program takes a number from the user and calculates the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence, which follows the pattern where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
8. **Find Common Elements in Lists**: This program first takes the number of elements for two lists from the user. It then receives two lists of numbers and displays the common numbers between these two lists.
9. **GCD and LCM Calculator**: This program takes two numbers and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM), displaying the results to the user.
10. **Most Frequent Character in a Word**: This program receives a word from the user and identifies the character that occurs most frequently in that word. It uses an auxiliary array to count the occurrences of each character efficiently.
11. **Parentheses Validator**: This program receives an expression from the user containing parentheses and checks if the parentheses are balanced (i.e., the number of opening and closing parentheses matches and the order is correct).
12. **Prime Factorization Calculator**: This program takes a number from the user and calculates its prime factors, displaying them.
13. **Prime Number Finder**: This program calculates and stores prime numbers, allowing the user to enter a number N to retrieve the Nth prime number. The prime numbers are stored in an array sequentially.
14. **Quadratic Equation Solver**: This program receives a quadratic equation from the user and solves it using the delta formula (Î”), calculating the roots. It indicates whether the equation has one, two, or no roots.
15. **Reverse Number Calculator**: This program takes an integer from the user and displays the reverse of that number (i.e., the digits of the number in reverse order).
